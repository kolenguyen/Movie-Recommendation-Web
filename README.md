    <h3>Your Website Description</h3>
    This assignment provides opportunities to use Django for back-end development. The end product is a
    dynamic website with modern styling and interesting event handling that provides a server API.
    <h2>Website Requirements</h2>
    <p>In HW4 you completed the front-end portion of your website. Now your objective
        is to <strong>implement back-end server functionality using Django and any supporting packages/libraries.</strong>! 
        You must create back-end features to satisfy the requirements below.</p>
    <p>You are free to add additional front-end content to make your site more complete. If you wish to choose a
        different topic than you submitted for HW4, you must create new front-end React contents for that topic.</p>
    <p>
        Complete <b>at least 4</b> of the following server feature requirements:
    </p>
    <ul>
        <li>Serve files to the client</li>
        <li>Create and use Django ORM models</li>
        <li>Save and load files on the server file system</li>
        <li>Authenticate a request to login and maintain a persistent user session</li>
        <li>Authorize users to do certain actions using model permissions</li>
        <li>One other feature of your choice</li>
    </ul>
    <p>
        You may use any packages and tools for Django/Python that help to implement your website.
        You are welcome to utilize packages that we did not cover in class.
    </p>
    <p>
        Please create a <b>new README file called "features.md"</b> that lists/summarizes the  back-end features that you have implemented. Additionally, use the provided .gitignore file to ensure any venv packages and npm modules are not uploaded. Note the sqlite3 DB file is not ignored to allow easier grading if you intend to have existing data in the database. Make sure your submission is in an ideal state with existing data to be properly assessed.
    </p>

    <h2>Best Practice and Git Requirements</h2>
    <p>Use <strong>best practice</strong> for all back-end contents. Examples of best practice:
    </p>
    <ul>
        <li>Use Python venv and freeze pip packages to requirements.txt</li>
        <li>Choose appropriate HTTP/HTTPS routes and request methods (GET, POST, PUT, etc.) 
            based on sent data and expected operation</li>
        <li>Encrypt sensitive data before saving in a database</li>
        <li>Develop API routes to be RESTful (Independent and Stateless using HTTP/HTTPS)</li>
    </ul>
    <p>
        Use <strong>appropriate Git practice</strong> to complete the homework. Create a branch to work on each page,
        and merge branches into main via a pull request. You may complete your own pull requests for this assignment.
