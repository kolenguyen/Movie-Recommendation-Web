# Movie-Recommendation-Web

# Project Description 

Movies and TV series are two of the most common and enjoyable forms of entertainment. With the rise of streaming services, such as Netflix, Disney+, etc, it has increased in popularity and thus, creating a new problem: content discovery. The vast libraries and genre can easily overwhelm users and make it difficult to find films that align with their individual taste and preference. Our project, the movies and series recommendation system, aims to resolve this issue by using machine learning models along with web development to tailor movie suggestions for users as a product. In addition, due to the increasing recognition of artificial intelligence as products, a recommendation system would be a good experience and reference for future employers.
